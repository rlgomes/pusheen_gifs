# pusheen gifs

A repo to house and share pusheen gifs I pulled from giphy.com and then curated
down to a collection of easily uploadable emojis.


# pulling emojis from giphy.com

I used the provided `scrape.py` scrip to pull the initial batch and then
manually curated things down to what you see here. You can install the
dependencies from `requirements.txt`


# adding more pusheen emoji

Feel free to put up a pull request with adjustments to the current set of
pusheen emoji's as I'll take almost any reasonable update/change


# uploading to slack

To upload to slack I first resized them using [gifsicle](https://www.lcdf.org/gifsicle/)
to resize and optimize the gifs and then [slack-emojinator](https://github.com/smashwilson/slack-emojinator)
to upload them to slack.
